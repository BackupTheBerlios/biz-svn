Biz - Web Application Framework
===============================

Biz is a GPL'd web application framework written in Python. It is currently in
active development.

Install
-------

Biz requires Python 2.4 to work, some of the examples may also depend on
recent versions of SQLObject and/or Cheetah.

Installing from source
......................

Biz uses the standard distutils, so all you have to do is::
	
	sudo python setup.py install

Note:
	If you are on Windows, you may want to copy ``bin/bizadmin.bat`` to a
	directory on the path.

Installing from RPM package
...........................

TODO

Installing from Win32 setup package
...................................

Just double-click on ``Biz-X.X.X.win32.exe``. You may need administrator
priviledges. The setup program creates ``bizadmin.bat`` for you at Python
``Scripts`` directory; make sure that, ``Scripts`` directory is on the path;
or you can copy ``bizadmin.bat`` to a directory on the path.
