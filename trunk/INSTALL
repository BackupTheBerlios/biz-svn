Installing Biz
==============


Biz requires Python 2.4 to work. Currently no other package is required for
basic usage.

Biz is regularly being tested on the following platforms:

* Ubuntu Breezy Badger *(development)* <http://www.ubuntulinux.org>
* Pardus 1.0 <http://www.uludag.org.tr>
* FreeBSD 6.0 <http://www.freebsd.org>
* Windows XP Professional (Turkish)

We don't have a Mac, so if you can test Biz there and inform us about the
success or problems, we would appreciate that.

Biz is packaged in four formats:

* Source tar.gz (platform neutral)
* Source zip (platform neutral)
* RPM (any architecture that can use it). Note that, this is automatically
  created by Python distutils and not tested.
* Win32 exe

Currently we don't have any deb packages, but you can convert RPM package to
deb using **Alien**. We occasionally test this option.


Installing From Source
----------------------


Assuming you have ``biz-X.X.X.tar.gz`` or ``biz-X.X.X.zip``,

1) Extract the file
    A. If it is a tar.gz file,

        a) on UNIX-like platforms, open a terminal and type (``$`` is the
        prompt)::

            $ tar xzvf biz-X.X.X.tar.gz

        b) on Windows, use a program that can handle it, such as 7zip_.

    B. If it is a zip file,

        a) on UNIX-like platforms, open a terminal and type (``$`` is the
        prompt)::

            $ unzip biz-X.X.X.zip

        b) on Windows, right-click on the file and choose, ``Extract All...``,
        follow the wizard.


2) Be sure you have administrator priviledges,

3) Biz supports Python distutils, so all you have to do is (``#`` is the prompt)::

    # python setup.py install
