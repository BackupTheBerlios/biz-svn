Welcome to Biz!
===============


**Biz** is a GPL'd cross-platform web application framework written in Python.
It currently features an easy-to-program API for writing easy-to-use
server-side web applications, application routing, a simple template system,
and necessary tools for creating and running Biz projects.

While creating Biz, we aim non-programmer users, one-man-army programmers and
small project teams working on small and medium size dynamic web sites.Once it
is completed, Biz will offer:

* An easy but powerful API for creating server&client-side web applications,
* Easily create and distribute web applications and deploy them in a web site,
* A platform for sharing web applications,
* Full support for i18n/i10n (internationalization/localization),
* Support for most popular HTTP servers (e.g, Apache, Twisted, Lighttpd, ...),
* Full WSGI-compliance at the application router level,
* Wrappers for 3rd party WSGI applications,
* A built-in ORM (object relational mapper) for database access.
   
We are in the *pre-alpha* stage right now, things are in flux, the API is
changing weekly, and there is not much documentation; but this is no excuse for
you not to try **Biz** :).

Biz is licensed under **GPL**, you may see the license in the ``LICENSE``
file.

Have a look at  ``INSTALL`` file for information on installing/uninstalling Biz
on your system. Biz is being tested on the following platforms regularly:

* Ubuntu 6.06 (Dapper) *(development)* <http://www.ubuntulinux.org>
