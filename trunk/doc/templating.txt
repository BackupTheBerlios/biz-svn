Introduction
------------

Biz includes a simple templating system for developers and users not wishing to
depend on an external templating framework (e.g., Cheetah).

Syntax
------

(Note: I am borrowing some Cheetah terminology here.)

Biz templating system offers three basic tools for the template writer,
*placeholders*, *directives* and *code-blocks*


Placeholders
............

Placeholders are filled with corresponding values in the namespace, they are
denoted by ``$placeholder`` or ``${placeholder}``, a placeholder should be a
legal Python identifier. Consider the following template::

  <a href="$link.target">$link.name</a>

``$link.target`` and ``$link.name`` are placeholders. Assuming ``link.target``
evaluates to ``http://biz.berlios.de`` and ``link.name`` evaluates to ``Biz
Homepage``, rendering the template produces the output below::
  
  <a href="http://biz.berlios.de">Biz Homepage</a>

You can use ``${placeholder}`` notation to tell the placeholder unambiguosly::

  Biz ${what}page

It is legal to use *square brackets* as part of a placeholder::

    $users[5]


Directives
..........

Directives are being used to inject some logic into the template. They occupy
strictly one line; no other template element can coexist with a directive on
the same line. There are three types of directives: headers, chains and
one-liners.

A *header* directive marks the beginning of a block. The block is made of one
or more lines of source which are processed to create output. Header directive
starts with ``{%``, after the block it ends with ``%}``, no text (except
whitespace) should be present before ``{%`` and after ``%}``::

    <table>
    {% for link in links
        <tr>
            <td><a href="$link.target">$link.name</a></td>
            <td>$link.description</td>
        </tr>
    %}
    </table>

In the example above, ``{% for link in links`` is the header directive, the
block starting after it and ending with ``%}`` is repeated for each link. Note
that the header **does not** end with a colon (``:``).

*Chain* directives maybe used to create linked blocks, such as
``if..elif..else``.A chain directive starts and ends like a header directive,
the intermediate conditions are written between ``%}`` and ``%{``, no other
text (except whitespace) should be present before ``%}`` and after ``%{``::

    {% if grade > 80
        A 
    %} elif grade > 60 {%
        B 
    %} else {%
        C
    %}

In the example above, ``if grade > 80`` is the header line, ``elif grade > 60``
and ``else`` are intermediate conditions; note that none of them ends with a
colon (``:``).

*Oneliners* are one lined Python statements. A oneliner starts with ``{%`` and
ends with ``%}``::
    
    {% a = 10; x = a ** 2 %}


Code-blocks
...........

While developing Biz, we are trying to separate logic from presentation as much
as we can, but some people are very comfortable with putting logic in a
template in the PHP-sense. It is possible to accomplish that by using many
directives, but it may become too complex, or ugly. Biz templating system
supports code-blocks using an alternate syntax, any code you write between
``{?`` and ``?}`` are run as Python code::

    {?
        class Person:
            def __init__(self, name, age):
                self.name = name
                self.age = age

        names = ["Ali", "Gulhan", "John", "Mary"]
        ages = [9, 24, 32, 19]
        people = [Person(*z) for z in zip(names,ages)]
    ?}

Note that, currently only *tab indented* code-blocks are supported (in the near
future this will change).


Extra Functions
---------------

Biz templating system supplies (currently) three extra functions to the
template designer, ``_echo``, ``_include`` and ``_loadbody``.


_echo
.....

``_echo`` function takes an arbitrary number of arguments, converts them to
string and adds their content to the output::

    {% _echo("Hello", "World!", 123 %}

Outputs::
    
    HelloWorld!123

Of course, you may pass variables::

    {% msg = "Hello, World!"; number = 42 %}
    {% _echo(msg, number) %}

Outputs::
    
    Hello, World!42
    
``_echo`` is used internally to output non-code parts of the template and you
will almost never need it; for instance, the template above can be written more
naturally, like this::

    {% msg = "Hello, World!"; number = 42 %}
    $msg$number


_include
........

This function takes a file name, interprets it and appends its output to the
output of the template.

Consider the following example; suppose that ``inner.tmpl`` has the following
content::

    {% if number == 42
        Hmm, you found the number...
    %} else {%
        Sorry, you couldn't find the number...
    %}

And ``outer.tmpl`` has this::

    {% number = 43 %
    {% _include("inner.tmpl") %}

Then, the output of this template will be::

    Sorry, you couldn't find the number...
    

_loadbody
.........

``loadbody`` takes the name of an HTML-like file, extracts the content between
``<body>`` and ``</body>`` and *returns* it; you should save it in a variable,
and output the variable.

The ``inner.html`` file contains::
    
    <html>
        <head><title>Useless</title></head>
        <body>This is useful.</body>
    </html>

The example template is::
    
    I can say that:
    {% body = _loadbody("inner.html") %}
    $body

Outputs::
    
    I can say that:
    This is useful.
