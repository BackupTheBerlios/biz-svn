Audience
--------

While we are developing Biz, we always keep three types of users behind our
minds:

1) Not programmer users: These users don't know, or don't care about
programming, they only want an easily configurable site, which they can add
applications which are created by others.

2) One-man-army programmers: They wa

3) Small development teams: These teams have developers and page designers, and
they want the logic separated from the content, and which in turn separated
from the presentation.


Biz Applications
----------------

Let's first define what a **Biz application** is,

**Application** An application *in the Biz sense* is a Python module that gets
a *request* and sends a *response*; it is attached to the first word of the URL
path. For example, in the URL, \http://www.company.com/TheProduct?format=html,
**wiki** is an application that gets ``TheProduct`` as an argument and a
keyword argument ``format`` with a value ``html``. If there is no path in the
URL, such as \http://www.company.com, the *index* application is invoked.


Biz Applications By Configuration
.................................

Reusability on the application level is the foremost priority of Biz; a person
should be able to add/remove web applications from his/her site as quickly and
easilyas possible, by modifying a configuration file or just using an
administration interface. Biz tries to satisfy this aim by splitting an
application into two parts: the configuration and the body. Application
configuration file contains at least the place where the body can be found. For
example a Biz project may have a configuration file for the *virtual folder*
application like this::

  [files] module=biz.apps.vfolder vfolder.location=/home/pingu/www

The virtual folder application serves the files in the directory given in the
``vfolder.location`` option; it is a standard application bundled with the Biz
package, so we use the ``module`` option to tell its place. The section name
(``files`` in this case) is not used currently, but it is best to assign a
meaningful name.

We should also inform Biz about the place of this configuration file, and under
which name it will be attached to the URL. Assuming the application
configration is saved under ``cfg`` as ``files.ini``, it is enough to add the
following line to ``biz.ini`` (in the project root directory) in
``[applications]`` section::

  [applications] files: cfg/files.ini

Easy, isn't it?
