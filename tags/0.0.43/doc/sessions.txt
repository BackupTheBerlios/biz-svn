Introduction
------------

[TODO: Define *session management* here]


Basics
------

Biz employs a cookie-based session management system. On each request, session
manager either creates a new session object if session cookie is not received,
or retrieves it if the session cookie is reveived; the session object is then
passed to the handler in the request. The session object is essentially a
Python dictionary, you can store any data type in it. When the handler
finalizes, the session manager updates its record using the received session
object.

In a Biz handler, session object might be used as the following:

1) Reading::
    
    username = self.request.session["username"]

2) Updating::
    
    self.response.session["username"] = "Bobo"

3) Deleting::

    del self.response.session["username"]

4) Closing::

    self.response.session.close()
